### Spread the Word

Make this message yours. The carbon accounting chicanery is straightforward to understand, verify, and explain to others.


### Legal

Join the [crowdsourced effort](https://ddebernardy.substack.com/legal) to defeat the green agenda in court.

If you have time, locate the protagonists involved in a few [climate related court cases](https://climatecasechart.com/) and highlight this work to them.

I'm also looking for a lawyer (or more) to draft generic _amicus briefs_ and _cease and desist letters_ to add to this repo, so volunteers can file and send them. In particular:

- An amicus brief for fossil fuel related climate cases

- A letter to notify academics and bureaucrats that they are contributing to land theft and murder

- A letter to notify green fund managers that they are engaging in carbon accounting fraud

[Reach out](mailto:dddebernardy@proton.me) or join the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/a_natural_language) if you can help.

Translation instructions are included at the end of the English manuscript.
